    description: "Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It\u2019s just
      a little bigger than Earth\u2019s Moon. Mercury itself, though, doesn\u2019t
      have any moons. It is the closest planet to the Sun, but it\u2019s actually
      not the hottest. Venus is hotter.\r\n\r\nAlong with Venus, Earth, and Mars,
      Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface that is covered
      with craters. Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere
      made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar wind and striking meteoroids.
      Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium,
      and potassium. Mercury doesn\u2019t have any moons."

    description: 'Venus looks like a very active planet. It has mountains and volcanoes.
      Venus is similar in size to Earth. Earth is just a little bit bigger.



      Venus
      is unusual because it spins the opposite direction of Earth and most other
      planets. And its rotation is very slow. It takes about 243 Earth days to spin
      around just once. Because it''s so close to the Sun, a year goes by fast. It
      takes 225 Earth days for Venus to go all the way around the Sun. That means
      that a day on Venus is a little longer than a year on Venus.



      Since
      the day and year lengths are similar, one day on Venus is not like a day on
      Earth. Here, the Sun rises and sets once each day. But on Venus, the Sun rises
      every 117 Earth days. That means the Sun rises two times during each year on
      Venus, even though it is still the same day on Venus! And because Venus rotates
      backwards, the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.



      Just like
      Mercury, Venus doesn''t have any moons.

    description: 'Our home planet, Earth, is a rocky, terrestrial world with an active
      surface featuring mountains, valleys, canyons, and plains. Unique as an ocean
      planet, water covers 70% of its surface, enabling diverse life.


      Our
      atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen and has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe.
      The atmosphere also protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break
      up in our atmosphere before they can strike the surface as meteorites.



      Since
      we live here, you might think we know all there is to know about Earth. Not
      at all, actually! We have a lot we can learn about our home planet. Right now,
      there are many satellites orbiting Earth taking pictures and measurements.
      This is how we can learn more about weather, oceans, soil, climate change,
      and many other important topics.'

      minus 85 degrees Fahrenheit \u2013 way below freezing. It is half the size
      of Earth. Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red because of rusty
      iron in the ground.\r\n\r\nLike Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes,
      canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide,
      nitrogen, and argon. People would not be able to breathe the air on Mars.\nThere
      are signs of ancient floods on Mars, but now water mostly exists in icy dirt
      and thin clouds. On some Martian hillsides, there is evidence of liquid salty
      water in the ground.\r\n\r\nScientists want to know if Mars may have had living
      things in the past. They also want to know if Mars could support life now or
      in the future.\r\n\r\n"

      to a star, but it never got massive enough to start burning. It is covered
      in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which

      a solid surface. It is still unclear if deeper down, Jupiter has a central
      core of solid material or if it may be a thick, super-hot and dense soup. Jupiter

    description: 'Uranus is made of water, methane, and ammonia fluids above a small
      rocky center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter and
      Saturn, but it also has methane. The methane makes Uranus blue.


      Uranus
      also has faint rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark. The outer rings
      are brightly colored and easier to see. Like Venus, Uranus rotates in the opposite
      direction as most other planets. And unlike any other planet, Uranus rotates
      on its side.

      Uranus is surrounded by a set of 13 rings.

      Uranus
      is an ice giant (instead of a gas giant). It is mostly made of flowing icy
      materials above a solid core.

      Uranus has a thick atmosphere made of
      methane, hydrogen, and helium.

      Uranus is the only planet that spins
      on its side.

      Uranus spins the opposite direction as Earth and most other
      planets.

    description: 'Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet
      in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the
      ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun.
      It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a small margin,
      but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made
      primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Pluto
      has roughly one-sixth the mass of Earth''s moon, and one-third its volume.


      Pluto
      has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging from 30 to 49 astronomical
      units (4.5 to 7.3 billion kilometers; 2.8 to 4.6 billion miles) from the Sun.
      Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its orbital distance of
      39.5 AU (5.91 billion km; 3.67 billion mi). Pluto''s eccentric orbit periodically
      brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance prevents
      them from colliding.

    description: "The Sun's gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything
      \u2013 from the biggest planets to the smallest particles of debris \u2013
      in its orbit. The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth drive
      the seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate, radiation belts and auroras.
      Though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered
      across the Milky Way galaxy.\r\n\r\nThe Sun has many names in many cultures.
      The Latin word for Sun is \u201Csol,\u201D which is the main adjective for
      all things Sun-related: solar.\nPop Culture\r\nThe Sun has inspired us since
      ancient times. It\u2019s central to mythology and religion in cultures around
      the world, including the ancient Egyptians, the Aztecs of Mexico, Native American
      tribes of North and South America, the Chinese, and many others.\r\n\r\nCountless
      musicians have written songs about the Sun. The Beatles had a hit in 1969 with
      \u201CHere Comes the Sun.\u201D Other popular songs that reference the Sun
      include: \u201CWalkin\u2019 on the Sun\u201D by Smashmouth; \u201CAin\u2019t
      No Sunshine\u201D by Bill Withers; \u201CWalking on Sunshine\u201D by Katrina

      or a fellow Kryptonian of comic book fame, your powers are heightened by the
