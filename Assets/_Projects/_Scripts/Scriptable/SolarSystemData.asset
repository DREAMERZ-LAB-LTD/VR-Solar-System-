    description: Mercury is the planet closest to the Sun. It is made up of rock
      and is the tiniest planet. It is so close to the Sun that it completes its
      orbit in 88 days and is much hotter than Earth
    PlaneObj: {fileID: 8978764467769538282, guid: 54e663ed6ff92124ba3e84931bff8669, type: 3}
  - solar: 1
    description: Venus is the second planet from the Sun after Mercury. It's also
      composed of stone. Venus, like Earth, has an atmosphere (air) surrounding it,
      but it is much thicker than Earth's, and Venus is perpetually clouded.

  - solar: 2
    description: This is our home! Earth is composed of rock and is the only planet
      with liquid water. The other planets are either excessively hot or excessively
      cold. It takes the Earth 365 days to orbit the Sun.

    description: Mars is slightly smaller than Earth, but much farther away. It once
      had an atmosphere similar to that of Earth and Venus, but it no longer has
      much of one. Mars is reddish in hue and is sometimes referred to as "The Red
      Planet.

    description: Saturn is well-known for its rings. Galileo spotted the rings for
      the first time (with a telescope) in 1610, and they are composed of a large
      number of little ice and dust particles (mostly ice).

    description: Jupiter is the biggest planet in our Solar System. Jupiter has the
      capacity to hold 1,321 Earths. It is one of the four "gas giants" and is made
      of gas. Jupiter has 66 moons, one of which is larger than Mercury.
    PlaneObj: {fileID: 6200441294366033232, guid: ba6dec7108d7d38408d6137ecf5cdda4, type: 3}
  - solar: 6
    description: "Uranus is another of the 'gas giants.' Uranus may hold 63 planets
      the size of Earth. Uranus orbits the Sun every 84 years and has the coldest
      average temperature of -220\xB0C.\r\n"

    description: Neptune is the planet that is the furthest away from the Sun. It
      is 30 times the distance from the Sun as Earth and takes 165 years to orbit
      the Sun. Neptune is the last of the four 'gas giants,' with a volume 58 times
      that of Earth.
